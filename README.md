About:

Netflix wants to analyze its extensive dataset to uncover viewer preferences and patterns, aiming to optimize content production and drive business growth. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I processed the data to handle missing values and performed various analyses to understand content distribution, genre popularity, and viewer engagement across different countries. The recommendations derived from analysis suggest creating diverse content, investing in popular genres, strategic release timing, international expansion, and data-driven decisions. These insights could lead to tailored content strategies for different regions, boosting viewer engagement and global subscriptions by producing content that aligns with audience preferences.
